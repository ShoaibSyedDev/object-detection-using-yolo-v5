CNN-based Object Detectors are primarily applicable for recommendation systems. YOLO (You Only Look Once) models are used for Object detection with high performance. YOLO divides an image into a grid system, and each grid detects objects within itself. They can be used for real-time object detection based on the data streams. They require very few computational resources.
